Afternoon challenge
## Core
Create a website about your favourite band using HTML (no css yet)
Elements that should be included:
    - A homepage, featuring photo of the band and a brief description (How they started, genre, controversy etc)
    - A discography page, showing their latest 3 studio albums in order of release, with an album cover and track listing
    - A bio page showing an unordered list of band members, with a photo, name, instrument for each
    - A navbar with links to the 3 pages
    - Heading on each page, telling the user which page they are on. Hompage should have title of the band
    - A footer with your copyright (make sure to use the symbol)
    - Throughout the site, try using HTML elements for effect! (e.g. <em> <b> etc)


    AFTERNOON CHALLENGE
We covered a lot in class today, and for some of those topic’s like position and display, we’ll be diving even deeper throughout the rest of the week. But Css is all about practice, so let’s start practicing!
Go through the band website you made yesterday and update it with some styling! Change up the font, add some colors, modify the sizing and play around with some of the stuff we went over in class. This challenge is intentionally open ended so get creative!
Once your band website is looking good, or if you want more direction, go to the bootstrap website and try to re-create some of the elements they provide (write the css from scratch don’t just copy-paste from the source code). The following components are a good place start, and should be do-able with what we covered in class!
- Alerts - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/alerts/
- Card - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/card/
- Navs - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/navs/
- Breadcrumb - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/breadcrumb/
then have a look at the challenges in this document https://github.com/CoderAcademy-MEL/html-css-challenges/blob/master/02-css-fundamentals.md
If you finish all the, have a look at the game Flexbox Zombies (https://mastery.games/p/flexbox-zombies) it’s a free game for learning the flexbox layout system (which we’ll look at tomorrow) (edited)
